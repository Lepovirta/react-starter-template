# Introduction
This is a starter template I created to create for my React.js projects. I use it to bootstrap my React.js project and so can you.

# Quick Start
## Development

1. Download this repository and unzip it.
2. Go to the folder you unzipped the project to and get all the npm dependencies:

        $ npm install
3. Start the development server:

        $ npm run dev
4. Open the application in your browser:

        http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/

Start making changes to the JS and SCSS files and see them magically update in your browser (on file save)

## Production

1. Build the application:

        $ npm run build
2. Copy the dist folder to your PROD server
3. Open the application in your browser:

        http://<your-domain>/index.html
